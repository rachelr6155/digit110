BALLAD OF BOOKER T.
by  
Langston Hughes 
<sentence>Booker T. 
<stanza type="1"><p>Was a practical man.  </sentence>
<sentence>He said, Till the soil  
And learn from the land. 
Let down your bucket  
Where you are. </sentence> 
<sentence>Your fate is here  
And not afar. </sentence>
<sentence>To help yourself  
And your fellow man,  
Train your head,  
Your heart, and
your
hand
.</sentence> </p>
<p><sentence>For smartness alone's  
Surely not meet—  
If you haven't at the same time  
Got something to eat. </sentence>
<sentence>Thus at <location>Tuskegee</location>  
He built a school  
With book-learning there  
And the workman's tool. </sentence>
<sentence>He started out  
In a simple way—  
For yesterday  
Was not
today. </sentence></p>
<p><sentence>Sometimes he had  
Compromise in his talk—  
<saying>For a man must crawl  
Before he can walk—</saying> 
And in <state>Alabama</state> in '85  
A joker was lucky  
To be alive.</sentence> 
<sentence>But Booker T.  
Was nobody's fool:  
You may carve a dream  
With an humble tool.</sentence> 
<sentence>The tallest tower  
Can tumble down  
If it be not rooted  
In solid ground. </sentence>
<sentence>So, being a far-seeing  
Practical man,  
He said, Train your head,  
Your heart, and
your
hand
.</sentence> </p>
<p><sentence>Your fate is here  
And not afar,  
So let down your bucket  
Where you are.</sentence></p> </stanza>
