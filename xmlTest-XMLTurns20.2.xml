            <quote source="Beatles"> “It was twenty years ago today/Sergeant Pepper taught the band
                to play..." </quote> Actually, it was <duration quantity="21.5" unit="year">21½
                years ago today</duration> that <persName>Jon Bosak</persName> pulled together the
            original <orgName>XML Working Group</orgName>. But yes, it was <event> on <date
                    when="1998-02-10">February 10, 1998</date> that <codeSpec>XML 1.0</codeSpec> was
                released to the world </event>. Which is worth talking about. </p>

        <p> It turns out that if you follow the pointers back, the original <codeSpec>XML 1.0
                Specification</codeSpec> is still out there &amp; <rs type="person" ref="Bray_Tim"
                >my fingers</rs> were the last to touch that document. The history of how XML came
            to be has been told at great length elsewhere, as have the details about <date
                when="1998-02-10">that February 10th</date>, so there’s no need to revisit. </p>

        <p>
            <event when="2018-02-10">Happy birthday!</event>
